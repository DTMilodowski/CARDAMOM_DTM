      #PSRF Potential Scale Reduction Factor

      #   [R,NEFF,V,W,B] = PSRF(X) or
      #   [R,NEFF,V,W,B] = PSRF(x1,x2,...,xs)
      #   returns "Potential Scale Reduction Factor" (PSRF) for
      #   collection of MCMC-simulations. X is a NxDxM matrix
      #   which contains M MCMC simulations of length N, each with
      #   dimension D. MCMC-simulations can be given as separate
      #   arguments x1,x2,... which should have the same length.
      #
      #   Returns 
      #     R     PSRF in a row vector of length D
      #     neff  estimated effective number of samples M*N*V/B
      #     V     estimated mixture-of-sequences variances
      #     W     estimated within sequence variances
      #     B     estimated between sequence variances
      #
      #   The idea of the PSRF is that if R is not near 1 (below 1.1 for
      #   example) one may conclude that the tested samples were not from
      #   the same distribution (chain might not have been converged
      #   yet).
      #
      #   If only one simulation is given, the factor is calculated
      #   between first and last third of the chain. Note that use of
      #   only one chain will produce over-optimistic result.
      #
      #   Method is from:
      #      Brooks, S.P. and Gelman, A. (1998) General methods for
      #      monitoring convergence of iterative simulations. Journal of
      #      Computational and Graphical Statistics. 7, 434-455. Note that
      #      this function returns square-root definiton of R (see Gelman
      #      et al (2003), Bayesian Data Analsyis p. 297).
